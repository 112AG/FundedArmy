                A former fitness entrepreneur turned full-time trader on a
                mission to build wealth, freedom, and future-proof financial
                skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                After losing everything in 2020, I rebuilt my life through
                relentless trading, mastering the markets, and creating a
                sustainable income. After cracking the markets through years of
                trial, losses, and a life-changing comeback trade, I didn't stop
                at just trading for myself. I built a PMS-style business in
                India, where 300+ investors trusted me with pooled capital.
              </p>
              <p>
                Month after month, I delivered returns not with hype, but with
                strategy. But I wanted more control, more scalability, and less
                regulatory noise.
              </p>
              <p>
                So now, I trade only funded accounts & personal capital working
                with prop firms that offer millions in risk-free capital. No
                more investor pressure â€” just pure performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Behind the scenes, I've quietly built powerful algorithmic
                trading bots across multiple financial markets designed for one
                purpose only: to compound wealth silently, automatically, and
                smartly.
              </p>
              <p>
                These bots aren't for sale. They're my private edge, used only
                for personal and funded account growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey is far from over, but one thing is clear: I don't
                chase trades. I build systems that print money.
              </p>
              <p>
                And now, I help others do the same with no BS, only real
                results.
